# Sound-Recognizer
This sound recognizer system is a Python application that listens to audio input from a microphone, processes the speech, and converts it into text. The system utilizes two main libraries: speech_recognition for capturing and recognizing speech, and pyttsx3 for text-to-speech synthesis.
